# Changelog

All notable changes to NOAA It All for Home Assistant will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.7.0] - Current

### Added
- **Solar and lunar eclipses, worked out for where you actually are.** Three sensors and two
  binary sensors on the existing **NOAA {OFFICE} Space** device, answering one question: if you
  walk outside, what will you see?

  - **Eclipse Visible Now** turns on an hour before first contact and off at last contact. This
    is the one to trigger an announcement from. Expect it on for a few hours a year at most, and
    in many years not at all.
  - **Eclipse Coming Up** turns on two weeks ahead of an eclipse worth planning around — a
    higher bar, because a partial eclipse worth glancing at is not one worth booking the day off.
  - **Eclipse Coverage** is the "will I get 29% or the whole thing" number.
  - **Eclipse Viewing Score** and **Next Eclipse** fill in the rest.

  Things worth knowing:
  - **It reports *your* eclipse, not the headline.** A total solar eclipse is total along a strip
    a couple of hundred kilometres wide and merely partial across a continent either side of it.
    Telling somebody who will see 43% that there is a Total Solar Eclipse tonight would be the
    most misleading thing this could do, so the type is always re-derived from your own geometry,
    with the global classification kept alongside as `global_type`.
  - **The percentage is what you can actually watch.** Coverage is measured at the best moment
    the Sun or Moon is above your horizon, not at the geometric maximum — which, for a site where
    the Sun sets mid-eclipse, happens underground. `visible_fraction` says how much of the event
    you get at all.
  - **Two percentages, because there are two honest readings.** `disc_covered` is the fraction of
    the disc's *area* hidden. Eclipse *magnitude*, the figure usually quoted, is the fraction of
    its *diameter* — magnitude 0.5 is only 39% covered. Both are reported.
  - **⚠️ Eye safety is part of the data.** Every solar eclipse carries `eye_protection_required`,
    `safe_without_filter` and an ISO 12312-2 notice, on both binary sensors as well as the score
    sensor — because the automation that fires from them is exactly the one that sends somebody
    outside to look at the Sun. Only **totality** is ever safe unfiltered. An **annular** eclipse
    never is: there is still a complete ring of photosphere at maximum.
  - **Lunar eclipses need no data at all** and stay correct indefinitely. Solar eclipses need
    Besselian elements from full planetary ephemerides, so NASA's are bundled for **2025–2075**
    — 114 eclipses, about 70 KB. Still no API call, no API key and no extra dependency. Extend or
    regenerate the span with `python3 scripts/build_eclipse_catalog.py`. Past the end of it the
    solar half says so and the lunar half carries on. *Eclipse Predictions by Fred Espenak,
    NASA's GSFC.*
  - **Contact times land within 20 seconds** of NASA's published values, checked against all 114
    catalogued eclipses. Each entry carries NASA's own answer at greatest eclipse purely so the
    test-suite can check the solver reproduces it — 114 regression cases with no hand-typed
    expected values and nothing that goes stale.
  - **The eclipse coordinator re-paces itself**, which no other coordinator here does. The others
    watch conditions that drift over hours; totality lasts two minutes. It recomputes hourly,
    every five minutes within six hours of first contact, and every minute while one is under way.
  - **Like the meteor score, it knows nothing about cloud** — deliberately, so the percentages
    stay correct for an eclipse fifty years out. Pair it with
    `sensor.noaa_{office}_weather_cloud_cover` in an automation; the README has an example.
  - **There is no eclipse map image entity.** One was built and then removed: NASA hosts a single
    static plot per eclipse, so the picture would have been unchanging for months at a time,
    absent entirely for the third of eclipses that are purely partial, and gone altogether past
    2050 where NASA's index stops. An image platform is for things that refresh, and eclipse
    predictions do not. The numbers are the product here.

### Changed
- `astro.py` gained `delta_t_seconds()`, and the module docstring no longer claims that modelling
  the TT–UT offset would be false precision. It is, for meteors. It is not for eclipse contact
  timing, where leaving it out costs up to two minutes — the whole point there being the instant a
  shadow edge crosses one spot on a rotating Earth.
- The observer-timezone cache is now shared between the two coordinators that compute rather than
  fetch, instead of being copied.

## [0.6.0]

### Added
- **The radar loop can now cover up to 24 hours instead of NOAA's fixed 50 minutes.** NOAA
  publishes a ready-made animation at `{SITE}_loop.gif`, but it is fixed at ten frames covering
  roughly 50 minutes, and only those ten frames exist on its server — so a longer loop cannot be
  downloaded, it has to be collected. The Radar Loop entity now fetches the latest single scan on
  each refresh, files it under the time NOAA published it, and assembles the animation itself from
  an evenly time-spaced sample of what it holds.

  Set the window under **Settings → Devices & Services → NOAA It All → Configure**, which gained a
  third step. It defaults to **24 hours**; `0` restores the previous behaviour exactly — NOAA's own
  loop, proxied unchanged, with nothing written to disk.

  Things worth knowing:
  - **The loop fills in over time.** A freshly configured loop is only as long as the history
    collected so far and reaches its full length after that many hours of uptime. Below six frames
    the card shows NOAA's own loop instead, so it is never blank and never worse than before.
  - **Frames survive restarts**, stored as one small GIF per scan under
    `<config>/noaa_it_all/radar_frames/<RADAR_SITE>/`. Budget a few megabytes per radar site.
    Anything outside the window — or dated in the future by a wrong clock — is pruned on every
    refresh. The directory is removed when the integration is deleted, when the entry is switched
    to another forecast office, and when the option is set back to `0`, unless another configured
    office is still building a loop from the same radar site.
  - **The animation is larger than NOAA's**, and every open dashboard re-downloads it whenever it
    changes. A 24-hour loop is capped at 72 frames (one every 20 minutes) and plays through in
    about ten seconds; shorter windows are proportionally finer, with a 6-hour loop keeping roughly
    one frame per scan.
  - Frames are identified by `Last-Modified` — the time NOAA published the scan — which puts them
    on the real volume-scan cadence rather than on our refresh boundary, and makes two refreshes
    that see the same scan resolve to the same file. Hashing the image bytes would have been
    actively wrong: two consecutive scans of a clear sky are genuinely identical, so a quiet night
    would collapse into a single frame and the loop would cut straight from "clear" to "storm" with
    no sense of time passing.
  - Every failure — too few frames yet, Pillow missing, assembly failing, a disk that will not take
    the frame — falls back to NOAA's own loop, and no failure path changes the picture already on
    screen.
- **The Radar Loop entity exposes what it is actually showing.** `loop_mode` is `local` when the
  animation was built here and `upstream` when it is NOAA's, alongside `loop_hours`, `frame_count`,
  `window_start` and `window_end` — so a loop quietly shorter than configured is visible from a
  template rather than only from the logs.

### Changed
- **The locally built loop is opaque where NOAA's is transparent.** Source frames are transparent
  overlays that each carry their own palette, and reconciling per-frame transparency across
  differing palettes is the most reliable way to produce a psychedelic radar loop. Frames are
  composited onto a solid black background before being combined. Cards that relied on the radar
  loop being transparent over a custom background will see black instead; set the option to `0` to
  keep NOAA's transparent animation.
- **Cached image validators are only offered back to the URL they came from.** The radar loop
  entity fetches two different resources, and an `ETag` from the single frame must never be sent as
  a validator for the animation — a server answering `304` to that would hand back the wrong image.

## [0.5.3] - Previous

### Fixed
- **A network blip no longer blanks the NOAA image cards.** Every image entity's `async_image()`
  returned `b""` on any failure, and Home Assistant treats empty bytes as an error and turns them
  into an HTTP 500 — so a momentary `Cannot connect to host services.swpc.noaa.gov:443 ... [Timeout
  while contacting DNS servers]` was enough to replace a perfectly good picture with a broken tile.
  Nothing was cached, so there was nothing to fall back on. The image bytes are now kept in memory
  and re-served: a failed refresh changes neither the cached frame nor `image_last_updated`, so the
  previous picture stays on the dashboard until a later refresh replaces it.
- **Images are fetched on a timer instead of while serving the HTTP request.** All seven entities
  now fetch in the background every 10 minutes, so a slow NOAA can no longer blow Home Assistant's
  10-second image-proxy budget, and several dashboard clients asking at once no longer each start
  their own request. The first fetch is scheduled rather than awaited during setup, so an
  unreachable NOAA cannot hold up the config entry.
- **`entity_picture` now points at Home Assistant's image proxy** (`/api/image_proxy/...`) once a
  frame has been fetched, instead of always sending the browser straight to `services.swpc.noaa.gov`.
  This is what makes the cache reachable — previously the browser fetched NOAA itself and the
  entity's own bytes were never used, so the card broke whenever *the browser* could not reach NOAA.
  Until the first successful fetch the entity still falls back to the upstream URL, so a restart
  while Home Assistant's own resolver is broken still renders if the browser's network is fine.
- **A total-request timeout is no longer reported as an unexpected error.** `aiohttp`'s
  `ClientTimeout` expiry raises `asyncio.TimeoutError`, which is not an `aiohttp.ClientError`, so it
  fell through to the catch-all arm and logged `Unexpected error fetching ... image`. Timeouts, DNS
  failures, connection resets and server disconnects are now classified together as transient.
- **Transient failures no longer log an error per blip.** A `cloud_polling` integration losing its
  upstream for a minute is normal. Consecutive failures now stay at debug while a cached frame is
  still being served, warn once the outage has lasted about half an hour, and only escalate to error
  after roughly an hour — and then only periodically. Recovery logs a single info line. A failure
  that is *not* transient (a 404, a content type that is not an image) still warns immediately, as
  does any failure while there is no cached image to show.
- **The declared content type now matches the actual image format.** Home Assistant defaults every
  image entity to `image/jpeg`; five of the seven are not JPEGs. The geoelectric field and hurricane
  outlook images are PNG, both radar images are GIF, and the content type reported by NOAA is
  adopted when it differs.
- **A single failed Points API lookup no longer disables forecasts until a restart.** This is the
  cause of the recurring `Error fetching NOAA Forecasts data: All forecast API requests failed`.
  `ForecastCoordinator._resolve_forecast_urls()` set `self._urls_fetched = True` in its `except`
  branch as well as on success, so one transient failure left both forecast URLs `None` with no way
  to retry — and because each fetch is guarded by `if self._forecast_url:`, no request was even
  attempted afterwards. Every subsequent refresh went straight to `UpdateFailed`, forever. The flag
  is now only latched on success, so the next 10-minute cycle re-resolves. The same latch was in
  `ObservationsCoordinator._resolve_station()` and `CloudCoverCoordinator._resolve_gridpoint_url()`,
  where it silently retired the observation-station and gridpoint lookups; both are fixed too.
- **Space weather and hurricane requests now send a `User-Agent`.** They were the only 5 of 19
  outbound requests without one, and `_HURRICANE_ALERTS_URL` points at `api.weather.gov`, which
  requires it.
- **`All X API requests failed` now says which endpoints failed and why.** The message discarded
  every underlying exception, so the log line naming the problem was useless on its own and the real
  cause sat in separate `WARNING` lines above it — when a request had been attempted at all. Failures
  are now collected and appended, e.g. `All forecast API requests failed: Points API lookup
  (ClientConnectorError: Cannot connect to host api.weather.gov:443 ...)`.
- **`coordinator.py` now has behavioural tests** (`tests/test_coordinator.py`). It had none, across
  773 lines and 10 coordinators, which is how the latch bug survived. Every new test was confirmed
  to fail against the pre-fix code.

### Changed
- **The seven image entity classes now share a `NoaaImageEntity` base.** Each was a near-identical
  copy of the same ~70 lines, which is why the `b""` bug existed in seven places at once. Subclasses
  keep only what differs: name, unique ID, device info, upstream URL, content type and a log label.
- **Image entities now report a state.** Previously all seven sat at `unknown` forever, because
  `image_last_updated` was never set. The state is now an ISO-8601 timestamp that advances whenever
  the image bytes change, which also makes "this image has gone stale" templatable.
- **The `User-Agent` now identifies this integration honestly.** It was
  `HomeAssistant/NOAA-Integration` on all 17 outbound request sites: generic, unversioned, carrying no
  contact information, and implying Home Assistant core rather than a third-party custom integration.
  `api.weather.gov` requires a User-Agent and asks that it be unique to the application, with a website
  or email so they can make contact instead of simply blocking traffic they cannot place — which matters
  more now that the integration polls on a timer. It is now
  `noaa_it_all/<version> (+https://github.com/dawg-io/noaa_it_all)`, built from `manifest.json` at import
  so a release bump is the only edit needed — `const.VERSION` and `const.DOCUMENTATION_URL` now read from
  there, and `tests/test_manifest.py` fails if either is ever pasted back in as a literal. A contact email
  may be added to the string later.
- **Refreshes revalidate with `ETag` / `Last-Modified`.** Because the integration now polls whether
  or not anyone is looking at the dashboard, conditional requests keep the steady-state cost close
  to zero for sources that publish infrequently. Requests also send the integration's `User-Agent`,
  matching the coordinators.

- **The documented dashboard templates no longer blow up during startup.** Home Assistant renders
  dashboard templates as soon as the frontend subscribes to them, which on a cold boot can be before
  this integration has registered its entities — `async_setup_entry` awaits an initial refresh of ten
  coordinators, all making live NWS calls, before forwarding any platform. In that window
  `state_attr(...)` and `states.sensor....` both return `None`, so the README's own examples raised
  `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable` and `UndefinedError: None has no element 0`, one
  traceback per card, intermittently. The three Extended Forecast cards, the upcoming-meteor-shower
  loop, the mobile header and the two alert automations now guard with `or []` and a truth test, and
  the Dashboard Card Examples section explains the race so new cards get written the same way. The
  sensors themselves were never at fault: `periods` and `upcoming` are always published as lists.
- **Removed a duplicated "Dashboard Card Examples" heading** in `README.md`.

### Known limitations
- Two configured NWS offices means two entities fetching the byte-identical geoelectric and aurora
  images, since those URLs are office-independent. Harmless but wasteful; a shared per-URL fetcher
  is the follow-up.

## [0.5.2]

### Fixed
- **Image entities no longer log an error on every startup.** `image.py` sets up its entities with
  `async_add_entities(entities, True)`, so Home Assistant calls `async_update()` *before* adding
  each entity — and `entity_id` is not assigned until after the add. The explicit
  `self.async_write_ha_state()` inside every image `async_update()` therefore raised
  `NoEntitySpecifiedError` on that first call, which the surrounding `except Exception` turned into
  `Error during <image> update: No entity id specified for entity ...` — one line per image entity,
  every startup. All seven writes are removed. Home Assistant writes the state itself exactly once,
  in `add_to_platform_finish()` after the entity is added, so the explicit call was redundant then
  and fatal before then. `update_before_add=True` is kept, so the image URL is resolved as the
  entity is set up rather than left empty.
- **Documentation entity IDs now match the entities the integration actually creates.** Every
  `sensor.`/`binary_sensor.`/`image.`/`weather.` reference in `README.md`, `CONFIGURATION.md` and
  `info.md` was checked against the 45 entity IDs produced by instantiating the real entity classes.
  128 references were wrong — most were missing the device-group segment
  (`sensor.noaa_ilm_temperature` instead of `sensor.noaa_ilm_weather_temperature`), had a phantom
  one (`sensor.noaa_weather_hurricane_activity` instead of `sensor.noaa_hurricane_activity`), or
  used a renamed metric (`kp_index` instead of `planetary_k_index`). All examples now use one
  office code (`ilm`) throughout, so adapting one means changing that single token.
- **The documented naming rule is now the rule the code follows.** `README.md` claimed "All
  entities use `_attr_has_entity_name = True`"; three do not. The device table listed a
  `NOAA Surf` device that does not exist (it is `NOAA {OFFICE} Surf`) and omitted `NOAA Hurricane`;
  `CONFIGURATION.md`'s pattern omitted the device-group segment entirely. Both documents now carry
  an **Exceptions to the pattern** table listing the five entity IDs that contain no office code,
  so a find-and-replace does not corrupt them. The rule itself is stated correctly: Home Assistant
  prepends the device name whether or not an entity sets `has_entity_name` — that flag only decides
  whether a redundant device-name prefix is stripped off the entity's own name first
  (`entity_registry._async_get_full_entity_name`).
- **Broken copy/paste examples fixed.** `state_attr()` calls naming attributes that do not exist
  (`total_alerts`, `alert_types`, `office`, `issued_time`, `product_link`) now use the real keys
  (`alert_count`, `alerts`, `office_code`, `issue_time`); the aurora automation's `condition: sun`
  with both `after: sunset` and `before: sunrise` — unsatisfiable at every instant, so it never
  fired — is now a `sun.sun` state condition; wind direction reads its `cardinal_direction`
  attribute rather than the state, which is degrees; and `notify.mobile_app` is written
  `notify.mobile_app_your_phone`, since the bare service is never registered.
- **Update frequency and legacy YAML corrected.** The docs claimed a 5-minute refresh; coordinators
  run at `DEFAULT_SCAN_INTERVAL = 10` minutes, and meteor sensors at 30. Legacy YAML was documented
  as providing "global sensors only" — it creates no entities at all and logs an error, which the
  docs now say.

### Notes
- The geoelectric and aurora images are `image.noaa_{office}_space_geoelectric_field_image` and
  `image.noaa_{office}_space_aurora_forecast_image`. An earlier revision of this release documented
  them without the device prefix, on the mistaken belief that omitting `_attr_has_entity_name`
  suppressed it. It does not — the device name is always prepended.
- An image entity **disabled in the entity registry** is never added, so the pre-add update was the
  only update it ever ran — the error repeated on every update instead of firing once at startup.
  That is how this surfaced.
- The remaining `async_write_ha_state()` in `weather.py` is intentional and unaffected: it is the
  forecast-coordinator listener, registered in `async_added_to_hass()`, so it can only fire after
  `entity_id` is assigned, and there is no platform-side write behind it.
- **Image entities are not polled.** Home Assistant's `ImageEntity` sets `_attr_should_poll = False`
  upstream, and `entity_platform` only arms a polling timer when some entity reports `should_poll`.
  So `async_update()` runs exactly once and the module-level `SCAN_INTERVAL` in `image.py` has no
  effect — the cache-busting `?t=` suffix is fixed for the lifetime of the config entry, and each
  image entity's state stays `unknown` because `_attr_image_last_updated` is never set. This is
  pre-existing behaviour, unchanged by this release, and is tracked as a follow-up.
- `tests/test_image.py` now runs `async_update()` on all seven image entities with an
  `async_write_ha_state` that raises, asserting nothing is logged as an error and that the image URL
  is still populated, plus a source-level guard so a new image entity cannot reintroduce the
  pattern.

## [0.5.1]

### Fixed
- **The Configure screen no longer fails with a 500.** `NOAAOptionsFlow.__init__` assigned
  `self.config_entry`, but Home Assistant made `OptionsFlow.config_entry` a read-only property that
  the framework populates itself, so opening options raised
  `AttributeError: property 'config_entry' of 'NOAAOptionsFlow' object has no setter`. The options
  flow now takes no constructor argument and reads the entry through the inherited property.
- **Saved options are now actually used.** The options flow writes to `config_entry.options`, but
  every runtime read used `config_entry.data`, so changing the location saved without error and
  then had no effect on any entity. `__init__.py`, `sensor.py`, `binary_sensor.py`, `weather.py`
  and `image.py` now resolve their configuration through the new
  `entry_config.resolve_entry_config()` helper, which lets saved options override the values
  entered at initial setup and falls back to those values per key.
- **Changing the location takes effect without restarting Home Assistant.** Nothing reloaded the
  config entry when its options changed, and the coordinators capture the office code and
  coordinates at construction with no way to re-point them — so even a correct read still needed a
  restart. The entry now registers an update listener that reloads it, rebuilding the coordinators
  against the new location.
- The options form pre-fills from the location currently in effect rather than from the original
  setup values, so reopening Configure after a save no longer shows stale coordinates.

### Notes
- Changing the **forecast office** rewrites entity IDs, which are derived from the office code, so
  the previous office's entities are left behind for manual cleanup. The config entry's title and
  `unique_id` also still reflect the office and coordinates chosen at initial setup, because
  options are stored separately from entry data. Migrating this flow to Home Assistant's
  `async_step_reconfigure` would address both and is tracked separately.
- The test suite's fake `OptionsFlow` now exposes `config_entry` as a getter-only property,
  matching real Home Assistant. The previous permissive stub is why CI stayed green on a crash that
  reproduced on every supported install.

## [0.5.0]

### Added
- **Meteor shower alerts and viewing forecast**, in the `NOAA Space` device group:
  - `binary_sensor.noaa_{office}_space_meteor_shower_active` — turns on only when a shower is
    genuinely worth going outside for, gated on both a real predicted rate (>=5/hour) and usable
    sky conditions (score >=25) so it stays off most nights rather than sitting permanently on
    (about 50 nights a year measured from Wilmington NC, clustered around the major showers)
  - `sensor.noaa_{office}_space_meteor_shower_activity` — the shower most worth watching now
  - `sensor.noaa_{office}_space_next_meteor_shower` — next shower to peak, with an `upcoming`
    attribute listing the next five for dashboard cards
  - `sensor.noaa_{office}_space_meteor_viewing_score` — 0-100 sky-conditions score with the best
    viewing window, expected meteors/hour, moon state and the limiting factor
- Bundled catalog of 29 meteor showers (`meteor_catalog.py`) keyed by **solar longitude** rather
  than by date, sourced from the IMO Meteor Shower Calendar and the IAU Meteor Data Center.
- `astro.py` and `meteor.py`: standard-library positional astronomy and the meteor rate model,
  with no Home Assistant dependency, verified against Meeus worked examples 7.a, 12.a, 13.b,
  25.a, 47.a and 48.a.

### Notes
- **This feature makes no network requests.** NOAA publishes no meteor shower data — the NWS
  alert taxonomy covers terrestrial hazards and the Space Weather Prediction Center covers
  geomagnetic activity, not meteors — and no live feed is needed, because Earth crosses the same
  debris streams at the same point in its orbit every year. Peak times are computed locally from
  each shower's stored solar longitude, so the catalog never needs a date update.
- Computed peak times are accurate to about **±11 minutes**, far finer than the hours-wide spread
  of real shower maxima and than the precision to which published maxima are themselves quoted.
- The viewing score measures **sky conditions, not shower strength** — the shower's ZHR cancels
  out of the relation, so a minor shower riding high under a new moon scores well while the
  Perseids behind a full moon score badly. Shower strength is reported as `expected_per_hour`.
- The score accounts for radiant altitude, moonlight and astronomical darkness. It does **not**
  account for cloud cover; pair it with the existing Cloud Cover sensor if you want that.
- No new dependencies: `requirements` remains `aiohttp` and `voluptuous`.

### Fixed
- **Binary sensors no longer repeat the device name.** All five existing binary sensors set a
  full `_attr_name` containing `NOAA {office}` while also carrying a device, so Home Assistant
  prefixed the device name a second time — producing
  `binary_sensor.noaa_ilm_surf_noaa_ilm_unsafe_to_swim` and the friendly name
  "NOAA ILM Surf NOAA ILM Unsafe to Swim". They now use `_attr_has_entity_name = True` with a
  local-only name, matching every sensor in the integration. Found by running the integration on
  a live Home Assistant instance.
  - **Existing installations are unaffected in any way that breaks automations.** The `unique_id`
    values are unchanged, so the entity registry keeps the entity IDs it already assigned. Only
    the displayed friendly name changes. Fresh installations get the shorter IDs
    (`binary_sensor.noaa_{office}_surf_unsafe_to_swim`); see the migration table in the README.
- Corrected the binary sensor entity IDs throughout README.md and CONFIGURATION.md. They
  previously documented IDs such as `binary_sensor.noaa_ilm_unsafe_to_swim`, which Home Assistant
  never actually produced.

### Changed
- Meteor shower entities refresh every 30 minutes rather than the integration default of 10,
  since nothing is fetched and the best-of-night result is stable for hours.

## [0.3.13] - Previous

### Added
- Dedicated `NOAA Hurricane` device that groups all global hurricane / NHC entities (Hurricane Alerts, Hurricane Activity, Hurricane Outlook Image, GOES Air Mass, GOES GeoColor) into a single device, independent of any configured NWS office.
- Location-specific aurora visibility predictions with timing and duration
- Solar Radiation Storm alerts with S1-S5 classification and location-specific risk assessment
- Forecast Discussion sensor (AFD product) with meteorologist-written technical analysis
- Cloud Cover sensor from NWS gridpoint data
- Radar Timestamp sensor for tracking radar image freshness
- Feels Like (apparent temperature) sensor with wind chill / heat index
- Comprehensive NWS Active Alerts sensor with severity and urgency breakdowns

### Improved
- Weather observations now fetched from nearest station using coordinates (weather.gov API)
- Device grouping organises all entities under NOAA Space, NOAA Weather, NOAA Surf, NOAA Hurricane, and NOAA Weather [OFFICE]

### Breaking Changes
- Hurricane sensors and hurricane image entities are no longer duplicated per configured NWS office. Their `unique_id` values changed from `noaa_{office}_hurricane_*` / `noaa_{office}_goes_*` to global IDs (`noaa_hurricane_alerts`, `noaa_hurricane_activity`, `noaa_hurricane_outlook_image`, `noaa_goes_airmass_image`, `noaa_goes_geocolor_image`). Existing entity registry entries from previous versions will become orphaned and may need to be deleted; the new entities will be created automatically under the `NOAA Hurricane` device.

## [1.0.20]

### Breaking Changes
- **Latitude and Longitude are now required fields** in Config Flow setup
- Weather data now fetched from nearest observation station to configured coordinates
- Users must reconfigure the integration to provide coordinates

### Added
- Config Flow UI setup with NWS office selector and coordinate inputs
- Location-specific weather observations from nearest NWS station
- Binary sensors for Severe Weather, Flood/Winter, Heat/Air Quality, and Active Alerts

## [1.0.0]

### Added
- Initial release
- Planetary K-Index sensor
- Geomagnetic Storm measurements
- Hurricane alerts and activity sensors
- Geomagnetic field and aurora forecast image entities
- Legacy YAML configuration support
