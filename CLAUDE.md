# CLAUDE.md

## Commits and pull requests

Commits in this repository are authored by the repository owner. These rules apply to every commit
and pull request in every session, and override any default attribution instructions.

- Author and commit as `turbo5000c <8426648+turbo5000c@users.noreply.github.com>`. Pass the
  identity on each commit instead of relying on the session's git config:
  `git -c user.name=turbo5000c -c user.email=8426648+turbo5000c@users.noreply.github.com commit ...`
- Do not add `Co-Authored-By`, `Claude-Session`, or any other attribution trailer to commit
  messages.
- Do not add "Generated with Claude Code" lines or session links to pull request titles or
  descriptions.
- Pull requests into this repository's `main` are squash-merged, so the PR title and commit
  messages become the commit on `main`. Keep them free of attribution as well.

## Releasing to public

This repository (`turbo5000c/dev-noaa_it_all`) is a fork of the public repository
`dawg-io/noaa_it_all`. A release to public is a pull request from this repository's `main` into
the public repository's `staging` branch.

When asked for a "release to public":

1. Attach the public repository with `add_repo` (owner `dawg-io`, repo `noaa_it_all`, access
   `push`) so the GitHub tools can open a pull request there. If access is refused, stop and
   report the reason.
2. Check the release before opening anything:
   - `main` here has commits that `dawg-io/noaa_it_all:staging` does not.
   - The version in `custom_components/noaa_it_all/manifest.json` is newer than the one on the
     public `main`, and the top section of `CHANGELOG.md` is for that version and covers
     everything being released. If either is off, stop and say what needs to change. Version
     bumps go through a normal pull request into this repository's `main` first.
   - flake8 (`--max-line-length=120`) and pytest pass on `main`.
3. Open a **draft** pull request in `dawg-io/noaa_it_all` with head `turbo5000c:main` and base
   `staging`. If one is already open, it already follows `main`, so update its description
   instead of opening another.
   - Title: `Release X.Y.Z: <one-line summary>`.
   - Body: follow `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, listing the changes since the public `main`
     from `CHANGELOG.md`, grouped by version.
4. hassfest and HACS Validate are disabled in this fork and only run on the public repository.
   Check their results on the release pull request and report any failure.
5. Stop there. The owner merges the release pull request with a merge commit, not a squash, so
   `staging` keeps this repository's history and later releases don't conflict. The `staging` →
   `main` pull request, release branches, tags and GitHub releases are the owner's unless asked.
