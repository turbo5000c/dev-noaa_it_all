## Installation & Configuration

### HACS Installation (Recommended)

#### Option 1: HACS Default Store (after acceptance)
1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click **Integrations**
3. Search for "NOAA It All"
4. Click **Download**
5. Restart Home Assistant

#### Option 2: HACS Custom Repository
1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click the three-dot menu (⋮) → **Custom repositories**
3. Add `https://github.com/dawg-io/noaa_it_all` with category **Integration**
4. Click **Download** on the NOAA It All card
5. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation
1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dawg-io/noaa_it_all/releases)
2. Copy the `custom_components/noaa_it_all` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

### Configuration

#### Config Flow (Recommended - New!)
For location-specific rip current, surf zone, and weather data:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Add Integration**
2. Search for "NOAA It All"
3. **Enter your Latitude and Longitude** (required) - Weather observations will be fetched from the nearest station to this location
<p align="left">
<img width="485" height="409" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/556faa39-2eee-45e7-8ba0-6771a334ef0a" />
</p>
4. Select your **NWS Forecast Office** from the dropdown (e.g., ILM for Wilmington, LOX for Los Angeles)
<p align="left">
<img width="490" height="222" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c9711bc-9c7b-428d-b7de-a405e07299e8" />
</p>
5. Complete the setup
<p align="left">
<img width="480" height="794" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2688c4dd-b6c6-4449-9ce2-37f5552335a8" />
</p>
**Important:** Starting with version 0.4.0, latitude and longitude are required fields for proper weather entity setup. Weather data is now fetched from the nearest observation station to your specified coordinates using the weather.gov API, rather than defaulting to the Home Assistant location or using a predefined office-to-station mapping.

#### Legacy YAML Configuration

> **Removed.** YAML configuration is no longer supported and creates **no entities**. If
> `noaa_it_all:` is present in `configuration.yaml`, the integration logs an error and sets nothing
> up. Remove the block and add the integration through **Settings → Devices & Services → Add
> Integration → NOAA It All**.

## Device Grouping and Organization

NOAA It All organizes entities into logical device groups for better organization in Home Assistant. All entities are automatically grouped under one of the following devices:

### Device Groups Overview

#### 🌌 NOAA Space
Space weather monitoring — aurora visibility, geomagnetic storms, solar radiation alerts — plus the meteor shower and eclipse forecasts
- **Device ID**: `noaa_space`
- **Location**: Space weather is global; meteor shower and eclipse entities use your configured latitude/longitude
- **Update Frequency**: 10 minutes for space weather, 30 minutes for meteor showers; eclipses recompute hourly, tightening to every minute while one is under way

<p align="left">
<img width="330" height="620" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50d6d649-dec7-4a52-a6db-d53488b7bbc3" />
</p>

#### 🌀 NOAA Hurricane
Global hurricane tracking and GOES satellite imagery — **created once**, shared across all configured NWS offices
- **Device ID**: `noaa_weather_hurricane`
- **Location**: Independent (global NHC/GOES data)
- **Update Frequency**: 5 minutes
- **Entities**: `sensor.noaa_hurricane_activity`, `sensor.noaa_hurricane_alerts`, `image.noaa_hurricane_outlook_image`, `image.noaa_hurricane_goes_air_mass`, `image.noaa_hurricane_goes_geocolor`

<p align="left">
  <img width="327" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b484039-abe9-4c14-ab37-91b41d084411" />
</p>

> **Important**: Hurricane and GOES satellite entities live under **NOAA Hurricane** only. They are never duplicated under office-specific devices, even if multiple NWS offices are configured.

#### 🌊 NOAA Surf
Location-specific surf conditions, rip currents, and water temperature
- **Device ID**: `noaa_surf`
- **Location**: Specific to configured NWS office
- **Update Frequency**: 5 minutes

<p align="left">
  <img width="331" height="330" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10961ad3-b813-4f82-9af4-ca02ad2682bf" />
</p>

#### 📍 NOAA {OFFICE} Weather
Location-specific weather observations, forecasts, alerts, and radar — **one device per configured NWS office** (e.g., "NOAA ILM Weather" for Wilmington, NC, "NOAA ILM Weather" for Wilmington)
- **Device ID**: `noaa_{office}_weather` (e.g., `noaa_ilm_weather`, `noaa_ilm_weather`)
- **Location**: Specific to configured NWS office and coordinates
- **Update Frequency**: 5 minutes
- **Radar image**: `image.noaa_{office}_weather_radar_base_reflectivity` (e.g., `image.noaa_ilm_weather_radar_base_reflectivity`)

<p align="left">
  <img width="263" height="910" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63d814c0-832c-485f-9317-f16dba72b6c0" />
</p>

> **Tip**: In Home Assistant's device view (Settings → Devices & Services), click on any NOAA device to see all related entities grouped together. This makes it easy to create dashboard cards and automations for specific categories of data.

All alerts are filtered to your specific location using latitude/longitude coordinates from config flow setup. Binary sensors are grouped under NOAA Weather [OFFICE] while the comprehensive sensor is under NOAA Weather.

### Current Weather Conditions (Config Flow Only)
Real-time weather observations from your local NWS observation station *(NOAA Weather)*:
- **Temperature**: Current temperature in °F *(sensor.noaa_{office}_weather_temperature)*
- **Humidity**: Relative humidity percentage *(sensor.noaa_{office}_weather_humidity)*
- **Wind Speed**: Wind speed in mph *(sensor.noaa_{office}_weather_wind_speed)*

> **Note**: Weather observations update every 10 minutes from the primary observation station for your configured NWS office location. Data includes automatic unit conversions to US customary units.

### Aurora Visibility Alerts (Config Flow Only)
Location-aware aurora visibility predictions *(NOAA Space)*:
- **Aurora Next Time**: Predicted timing when aurora activity may begin at your location *(sensor.noaa_{office}_space_aurora_next_time)*
- **Aurora Duration**: Estimated length of aurora visibility in hours based on geomagnetic conditions *(sensor.noaa_{office}_space_aurora_duration)*
- **Aurora Visibility Probability**: Percentage chance of aurora visibility from your specific location *(sensor.noaa_{office}_space_aurora_visibility_probability)*

> **Note**: Aurora predictions are based on real-time Kp index data and your location's magnetic latitude. Northern locations (like Duluth, MN) have much higher visibility potential than southern locations (like Miami, FL).

### Solar Radiation Storm Alerts (Config Flow Only)
Location-aware monitoring of solar radiation storm activity *(NOAA Space)*:
- **Solar Radiation Storm Alerts**: Location-aware monitoring of solar radiation storm activity with S1-S5 classification *(sensor.noaa_{office}_space_solar_radiation_storm_alerts)*

  - **Real-time Alerts**: Live monitoring of NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center alerts

> **Note**: Solar radiation storm impacts vary by location and magnetic latitude. Higher latitudes (like Alaska and northern Canada) experience more severe effects, while equatorial regions are generally less affected. The integration provides location-specific risk assessments for your configured NWS office.

### Meteor Showers (Config Flow Only)
Meteor shower alerts and a viewing forecast for your exact location *(NOAA Space)*:

- **Meteor Shower Activity**: The shower most worth watching right now, or `None` *(sensor.noaa_{office}_space_meteor_shower_activity)*
  - Attributes include the current ZHR, peak time in your local timezone, radiant altitude, parent body, and a list of every shower currently active
- **Next Meteor Shower**: The next shower to reach maximum *(sensor.noaa_{office}_space_next_meteor_shower)*
  - The `upcoming` attribute holds the next five showers with peak dates — this is what dashboard "what's coming up" cards read from
- **Meteor Viewing Score**: How good tonight's sky is, 0–100% *(sensor.noaa_{office}_space_meteor_viewing_score)*
  - Attributes include `rating`, `best_window_start`/`best_window_end` (when to actually go outside), `expected_per_hour`, `moon_illumination`, `moon_altitude`, `darkness`, and `limiting_factor`
- **Meteor Shower Active**: Turns on when a shower is genuinely worth going outside for *(binary_sensor.noaa_{office}_space_meteor_shower_active)*
  - Requires both a real predicted rate (≥5/hour) and usable sky conditions (score ≥25), so it stays off most nights instead of sitting permanently on
  - Measured over 2026 from Wilmington NC that is about 50 nights, clustered around the major showers (~13 for the Perseids, 8 for the Orionids, 7 for the Geminids) — the Perseids really do stay above 5/hour for roughly six days either side of maximum

> **Note on the data source**: NOAA publishes no meteor shower data, and neither does anyone else as a live feed — none is needed. Earth crosses the same debris streams at the same point in its orbit every year, so this feature ships a catalog of ~29 showers keyed by **solar longitude** and computes each year's peak time locally. There is no API call, no API key, and no extra dependency, and it keeps working with no internet connection. Computed peak times are accurate to about ±11 minutes, which is far finer than the hours-wide spread of real shower maxima.

> **Note on the score**: The viewing score measures *sky conditions*, not shower strength — it is the fraction of the ideal meteor rate you would actually achieve, so a minor shower riding high under a new moon scores well while the Perseids behind a full moon score badly. Shower strength is reported separately as `expected_per_hour`. The score accounts for radiant altitude, moonlight and astronomical darkness. It does **not** account for cloud cover; pair it with `sensor.noaa_{office}_weather_cloud_cover` if you want that.

### Solar and Lunar Eclipses (Config Flow Only)
Eclipse alerts and a viewing forecast for your exact location *(NOAA Space)*:

- **Next Eclipse**: The next eclipse visible from where you are, named the way *you* will see it *(sensor.noaa_{office}_space_next_eclipse)*
  - Attributes include the local start/maximum/end times, how much of the disc you get, where to look, and an `upcoming` list of the next five
- **Eclipse Coverage**: How much of the Sun or Moon you will actually see covered, 0–100% *(sensor.noaa_{office}_space_eclipse_coverage)*
  - This is the "will I get 29% or the whole thing" number
- **Eclipse Viewing Score**: How worthwhile it is from here, 0–100% *(sensor.noaa_{office}_space_eclipse_viewing_score)*
  - Attributes include `rating`, `watch_from_local`/`watch_until_local`, `look_towards`, the totality window, `limiting_factor`, and the eye-safety notice
- **Eclipse Visible Now**: Turns on an hour before first contact and off at last contact *(binary_sensor.noaa_{office}_space_eclipse_visible_now)*
  - The one to trigger an announcement from. Expect it on for a few hours a year at most, and in many years not at all
- **Eclipse Coming Up**: Turns on two weeks before an eclipse worth planning around *(binary_sensor.noaa_{office}_space_eclipse_coming_up)*
  - A higher bar than the live alert: a partial eclipse worth glancing at is not one worth booking the day off for

> **⚠️ Eye safety**: Never look at a partially eclipsed Sun without ISO 12312-2 eclipse glasses or a certified solar filter — sunglasses, exposed film and smoked glass are **not** safe. Only during **totality**, between second and third contact, may the Sun be viewed with the naked eye, and the filter goes back on the instant the first sliver reappears. An **annular** eclipse is never safe to view unfiltered: there is still a complete ring of photosphere at maximum. Every solar entity carries `eye_protection_required`, `safe_without_filter` and an `eye_safety` string so an automation can read the warning out.

> **Note on "your" eclipse**: A total solar eclipse is total along a strip a couple of hundred kilometres wide and merely partial across a whole continent either side of it. Everything here reports the eclipse **you** get — a 43% partial is reported as a partial eclipse, with the headline classification kept alongside as `global_type`. Likewise `disc_covered`, the viewing score and `look_towards` are all measured at the best moment the Sun or Moon is actually above your horizon, so a site where the body sets mid-eclipse is not advertised a maximum that happens underground, or pointed at a horizon the Moon has already set behind. `visible_fraction` says how much of the event you get at all, and `altitude_at_maximum` still reports the geometric peak for reference.

> **Note on the two percentages**: `disc_covered` is the fraction of the disc's **area** that is hidden. Eclipse *magnitude*, the figure usually quoted, is the fraction of its **diameter**, and the two are far apart — magnitude 0.5 is only 39% covered. Both are reported so you can compare against a published table.

> **Note on the data source**: Lunar eclipses are computed from first principles and stay correct indefinitely. Solar eclipses need Besselian elements from full planetary ephemerides, so this feature bundles NASA's for **2025–2075** — 114 eclipses — and does the observer-specific geometry locally. There is no API call, no API key and no extra dependency, and it keeps working with no internet connection. Computed contact times land within 20 seconds of NASA's published values, checked against all 114. Regenerate or extend the catalog with `python3 scripts/build_eclipse_catalog.py`. *Eclipse Predictions by Fred Espenak, NASA's GSFC.*

> **Note on the score**: Unlike the meteor viewing score this deliberately does **not** factor out the strength of the event — whether the Moon covers a tenth of the Sun or all of it is the single most important thing about a solar eclipse. It accounts for how much is covered, how high the Sun or Moon sits, and for lunar eclipses how dark the sky is. It does **not** account for cloud cover; pair it with `sensor.noaa_{office}_weather_cloud_cover` if you want that.

### Optional Secondary Sensors (Config Flow Only)
These sensors provide additional weather data where available from NOAA/NWS *(NOAA Weather)*:

- **Cloud Cover**: Current cloud coverage percentage from NWS gridpoint data *(sensor.noaa_{office}_weather_cloud_cover)*
  - Returns percentage (0-100%) of sky covered by clouds
  - Updated from forecast gridpoint data for your location
  - Requires latitude/longitude configuration
  - May not be available for all locations

- **Radar Timestamp**: Timestamp of the latest radar image for your NWS office *(sensor.noaa_{office}_weather_radar_timestamp)*
  - Shows when the most recent radar image was captured
  - Useful for automations or displaying radar freshness
  - Based on NEXRAD radar site for your office location
  - Available for most coastal and land-based offices

- **Forecast Discussion**: Meteorologist-written forecast discussion (AFD product) *(sensor.noaa_{office}_weather_forecast_discussion)*
  - Detailed technical analysis from local NWS meteorologists
  - Includes reasoning behind forecast decisions
  - Updated when new forecast discussions are issued (typically 2-3 times daily)
  - State is the literal `Available` (or unknown); the text lives in the `full_text` and
    `summary` attributes
  - Provides insight into weather patterns and forecast confidence

### Forecast Sensors and the Weather Entity (Config Flow Only)

- **Extended Forecast**: Multi-day NWS forecast *(sensor.noaa_{office}_weather_extended_forecast)* —
  periods are in the `forecast` attribute
- **Hourly Forecast**: Hour-by-hour NWS forecast *(sensor.noaa_{office}_weather_hourly_forecast)*
- **Weather**: A full Home Assistant weather entity backed by NWS observations and forecasts
  *(weather.noaa_{office}_weather)* — use this with the standard Weather Forecast card, and with
  `weather.get_forecasts` in templates. Note the single `weather` in the ID, not `_weather_weather`.

### Derived Space Weather Sensors (Config Flow Only)

- **Geomagnetic Storm Interpretation**: Plain-language reading of the Dst value
  *(sensor.noaa_{office}_space_geomagnetic_storm_interpretation)*
- **Planetary K-Index Rating**: Plain-language reading of the Kp value
  *(sensor.noaa_{office}_space_planetary_k_index_rating)*

> **Note**: These sensors gracefully handle missing data by returning `None` or `Unknown` when data is unavailable. The `availability` attribute indicates data source and current status. **UV Index is NOT available** through NWS APIs and cannot be provided by this integration.

### Image Entities
Visual representations of current conditions:

**NOAA Space** (global, shared):
- **Geomagnetic Field Image** — Real-time geomagnetic storm intensity visualization *(image.noaa_ilm_space_geoelectric_field_image)*
- **Aurora Forecast Image** — Tonight's aurora coverage forecast *(image.noaa_ilm_space_aurora_forecast_image)*

**NOAA Hurricane** (global, created once):
- **Outlook Image** — 2-day tropical weather outlook from NHC *(image.noaa_hurricane_outlook_image)*
- **GOES Air Mass** — GOES-19 Air Mass RGB satellite imagery *(image.noaa_hurricane_goes_air_mass)*
- **GOES Geocolor** — GOES-19 GeoColor satellite imagery *(image.noaa_hurricane_goes_geocolor)*

**NOAA {OFFICE} Weather** (one per configured office):
- **Radar Base Reflectivity** — Latest NEXRAD base reflectivity radar for your NWS office *(image.noaa_{office}_weather_radar_base_reflectivity)*
- **Radar Loop** — Animated NEXRAD radar loop, covering up to 24 hours *(image.noaa_{office}_weather_radar_loop)*

> **Radar loop history**: NOAA's own radar animation is fixed at ten frames covering roughly 50 minutes, and only those ten frames exist on its server — a longer loop cannot simply be downloaded. So the integration collects one frame per refresh and assembles the animation itself. The window defaults to **24 hours** and is set under **Settings → Devices & Services → NOAA It All → Configure**; set it to `0` to serve NOAA's 50-minute loop unchanged and store nothing.
>
> Worth knowing before you turn it up:
>
> - **It fills in over time.** A newly configured loop starts at whatever history has been collected so far and reaches its full length after that many hours of uptime. Until there are enough frames, the card shows NOAA's own loop instead, so it is never blank.
> - **Frames survive restarts.** They are stored under `<config>/noaa_it_all/radar_frames/<RADAR_SITE>/`, so a restart does not send the loop back to the beginning. Budget a few megabytes per radar site; the directory is deleted if you remove the integration.
> - **The animation is bigger than NOAA's.** A 24-hour loop is sampled down to 72 frames (one every 20 minutes) and plays through in about ten seconds, but it is still a larger file that every open dashboard re-downloads whenever it changes. Shorter windows are proportionally finer: a 6-hour loop keeps one frame per scan.
>
> The entity's `loop_mode` attribute reports whether you are looking at a locally built animation (`local`) or NOAA's (`upstream`), alongside `frame_count`, `window_start` and `window_end`.

> **Tip**: Image entities can be displayed on dashboards using the standard `picture-entity` or `picture-glance` cards.
>
> Home Assistant fetches each image from NOAA in the background every 10 minutes and serves it to the browser through its own image proxy (`/api/image_proxy/...`), so the dashboard does not talk to NOAA directly. The most recently fetched frame is kept in memory: if NOAA is briefly unreachable the card keeps showing the last good image rather than going blank, and the outage is logged quietly unless it persists. Each entity's state is the timestamp of the image currently being served, so you can alert on an image going stale.

## NWS Forecast Offices

The integration supports all NWS offices that issue Surf Zone Forecasts (SRF):

**East Coast**: Norfolk (AKQ), Boston (BOX), Wilmington (ILM), Charleston (CHS), Jacksonville (JAX), Miami (MFL), Tampa (TBW), etc.

**West Coast**: Wilmington (ILM), Los Angeles (LOX), San Francisco (MTR), Portland OR (PQR), Eureka (EKA)

**Gulf Coast**: Mobile (MOB), Corpus Christi (CRP), Brownsville (BRO), Tallahassee (TAE)

**Great Lakes**: Chicago (LOT), Cleveland (CLE), Detroit (DTX), Milwaukee (MKX), Duluth (DLH)

**Pacific**: Honolulu (HFO), Guam (GUM)

## Entity Naming Conventions

Understanding entity naming helps you quickly identify and use sensors in automations and dashboards.

Home Assistant derives the entity ID by combining the **device name** slug with the entity's
own **name** slug. The device name is prepended whether or not the integration sets
`_attr_has_entity_name` — that flag only decides whether a redundant device-name prefix is
stripped off the entity's own name first. The five global hurricane entities are the exception,
because their device carries no office code — see
[Exceptions to the pattern](#exceptions-to-the-pattern) below.

**Every example in this document uses the `ILM` office.** To adapt one to your own location,
replace `ilm` with your office code in lower case — and leave the entities listed under
[Exceptions to the pattern](#exceptions-to-the-pattern) alone, because they carry no office code.

### Naming Patterns by Device

| Device | Device Name Pattern | Example Entity ID |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| NOAA Hurricane | `NOAA Hurricane` (global — no office code) | `sensor.noaa_hurricane_activity` |
| NOAA {OFFICE} Weather | `NOAA {OFFICE} Weather` | `sensor.noaa_ilm_weather_visibility` |
| NOAA {OFFICE} Space | `NOAA {OFFICE} Space` | `sensor.noaa_ilm_space_planetary_k_index` |
| NOAA {OFFICE} Surf | `NOAA {OFFICE} Surf` | `sensor.noaa_ilm_surf_rip_current_risk` |

**Examples:**
- `sensor.noaa_ilm_weather_temperature` — Temperature for Wilmington (ILM office)
- `binary_sensor.noaa_ilm_surf_unsafe_to_swim` — Rip current safety for Wilmington
- `sensor.noaa_hurricane_activity` — Global hurricane activity (NOAA Hurricane device)
- `image.noaa_hurricane_outlook_image` — Hurricane outlook image (NOAA Hurricane device)
- `image.noaa_ilm_weather_radar_base_reflectivity` — Radar base reflectivity for Wilmington (ILM)
- `image.noaa_ilm_weather_radar_loop` — Radar loop for Wilmington (ILM)

### Exceptions to the pattern

These five entity IDs do **not** contain an office code, because they live on the shared,
office-independent `NOAA Hurricane` device. When you copy an example and swap the office code,
skip these — substituting into them produces an entity that does not exist:

| Entity ID | Why |
|---|---|
| `sensor.noaa_hurricane_alerts` | Global NHC data, on the shared `NOAA Hurricane` device |
| `sensor.noaa_hurricane_activity` | Global NHC data, on the shared `NOAA Hurricane` device |
| `image.noaa_hurricane_outlook_image` | Global NHC data, on the shared `NOAA Hurricane` device |
| `image.noaa_hurricane_goes_air_mass` | Global GOES imagery, on the shared `NOAA Hurricane` device |
| `image.noaa_hurricane_goes_geocolor` | Global GOES imagery, on the shared `NOAA Hurricane` device |

Two further IDs are easy to get wrong even though they do follow the rule:

- `sensor.noaa_{office}_surf_surf_height` — the word "surf" appears **twice**: once for the
  `NOAA {OFFICE} Surf` device and once for the "Surf Height" entity name.
- `weather.noaa_{office}_weather` — a single `weather`, not a doubled `_weather_weather`; this
  entity does not set `has_entity_name`, so its ID comes from its own name alone.

### Office Code Usage
- **Office-specific entities**: Include the office code in the device name (e.g., `NOAA ILM Weather`)
- **Global hurricane entities**: Always under `NOAA Hurricane` — never duplicated per office
- **Replace office code**: If you change NWS offices, entity IDs for office-scoped entities will
  include the new code. Entity IDs also embed the configured latitude/longitude in their
  `unique_id`, so changing coordinates re-registers those entities — see the note in the Changelog.

### Entity Types
- **sensor.**: Numeric or text state (temperature, humidity, alert count, etc.)
- **binary_sensor.**: On/Off or True/False state (unsafe conditions, active alerts)
- **image.**: Visual data (radar, satellite, forecast images)

### Best Practices

1. **Use Device Views**: Access entities by device (Settings → Devices & Services → NOAA It All) for organized browsing
2. **Create Groups**: Use Home Assistant groups to combine related entities across device boundaries
3. **Label Your Location**: In automations, use friendly names in messages (e.g., "Wilmington" instead of "ILM")
4. **Check Availability**: Sensors return `unknown` or `None` when data is unavailable - use conditions to verify state
5. **Binary Sensors for Triggers**: Use binary sensors (`on`/`off`) for automation triggers instead of checking sensor values
6. **Access Attributes**: Many sensors include detailed information in attributes (e.g., full alert text, forecast periods)

| Radar Image | `image.noaa_{office}_weather_radar_{name}` | `image.noaa_ilm_weather_radar_base_reflectivity` |

### Migration: Old Entity IDs

If you are upgrading from a previous version, the following image entity IDs have changed:

| Old Entity ID | New Entity ID |
|---------------|---------------|
| `image.noaa_weather_hurricane_outlook_image` | `image.noaa_hurricane_outlook_image` |
| `image.noaa_weather_noaa_satellite_goes_air_mass` | `image.noaa_hurricane_goes_air_mass` |
| `image.noaa_weather_noaa_satellite_goes_geocolor` | `image.noaa_hurricane_goes_geocolor` |
| `image.noaa_weather_radar_base_reflectivity_{office}` | `image.noaa_{office}_weather_radar_base_reflectivity` |

The underlying unique IDs for GOES Air Mass and GOES Geocolor have also changed, so Home Assistant will register them as new entities. To clean up stale entries, go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Entities**, filter by "unavailable", and remove the old image entities. Update any automations or dashboard cards that reference the old entity IDs.

#### Binary sensor names (0.5.0)

Before 0.5.0 the binary sensors set a full name that already contained `NOAA {office}`, which Home Assistant then prefixed with the device name again. The result was a doubled entity ID and friendly name:

| Before 0.5.0 | From 0.5.0 |
|---|---|
| `binary_sensor.noaa_{office}_surf_noaa_{office}_unsafe_to_swim` | `binary_sensor.noaa_{office}_surf_unsafe_to_swim` |
| `binary_sensor.noaa_{office}_weather_noaa_{office}_severe_weather_alert` | `binary_sensor.noaa_{office}_weather_severe_weather_alert` |
| `binary_sensor.noaa_{office}_weather_noaa_{office}_flood_winter_alert` | `binary_sensor.noaa_{office}_weather_flood_winter_alert` |
| `binary_sensor.noaa_{office}_weather_noaa_{office}_heat_air_quality_alert` | `binary_sensor.noaa_{office}_weather_heat_air_quality_alert` |
| `binary_sensor.noaa_{office}_weather_noaa_{office}_active_alerts` | `binary_sensor.noaa_{office}_weather_active_alerts` |

**Existing installations keep their current entity IDs and nothing breaks.** The `unique_id` values are unchanged, so Home Assistant's entity registry holds on to whatever ID it already assigned — your automations and dashboard cards keep working untouched. What does change is the displayed friendly name, which loses the stutter (for example "NOAA ILM Surf NOAA ILM Unsafe to Swim" becomes "NOAA ILM Surf Unsafe to Swim").

Only fresh installations get the shorter entity IDs. If you would like an existing installation to match, rename the entities yourself in **Settings → Devices & Services → Entities**, then update any automations that reference the old IDs.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Entities Not Appearing
- Ensure you completed Config Flow setup with valid latitude and longitude
- Verify your NWS office code is listed in the [supported offices](#nws-forecast-offices) table
- Restart Home Assistant after adding or reconfiguring the integration
- Check **Settings** → **System** → **Logs** for any error messages from `noaa_it_all`

### Data Not Updating
- Check sensor attributes for error messages
- Verify internet connectivity from your Home Assistant instance
- NOAA APIs occasionally experience temporary outages; sensors will recover automatically
- Confirm scan interval is running: entities should show a `last_changed` time within the last 10 minutes

### Incorrect or Missing Weather Data
- Weather observations are pulled from the nearest NWS station to your configured coordinates
- Confirm your latitude and longitude are accurate (you can reconfigure via **Settings** → **Integrations** → **NOAA It All** → **Configure**)
- Some NWS offices may not have nearby observation stations; in that case observations will show `unknown`

### Binary Sensors Always Off
- Binary sensors require Config Flow setup with a valid office code and coordinates
- Legacy YAML configuration does not support location-specific binary sensors

### Integration Fails to Load
- Confirm Home Assistant version is **2024.9.1 or newer**
- Check that required Python packages (`requests`, `aiohttp`) are available (they are bundled with HACS installations)
- Review Home Assistant logs for specific import or configuration errors

### FAQ

**Q: Can I use this integration without configuring latitude/longitude?**
A: Yes. Adding `noaa_it_all:` to `configuration.yaml` provides global sensors (Kp Index, Geomagnetic Storm, Hurricane data) without location-specific features.

**Q: How do I find my NWS forecast office code?**
A: Visit [weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov/) and search for your location. The three-letter office code appears in the URL of your local forecast page (e.g., `forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=San+Diego&state=CA&site=ILM`).

**Q: Why don't I see aurora predictions?**
A: Aurora predictions are location-specific and require Config Flow setup. Also, aurora is only visible at high Kp levels for southern latitudes — check the Kp Index value and your office's magnetic latitude.

**Q: How often does data update?**
A: Most sensors update every 10 minutes; meteor shower sensors recompute every 30 minutes.

**Q: Are UV Index readings available?**
A: No. UV Index is not provided through NWS/NOAA APIs and cannot be included in this integration.

**Q: Where can I report bugs or request features?**
A: Please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/dawg-io/noaa_it_all/issues).

## Data Sources

- **Space Weather**: NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center
  - Aurora visibility forecasts and geomagnetic storm data
  - Solar radiation storm alerts and classification (S1-S5 scale)
  - Real-time space weather alert monitoring
- **Meteor Showers**: bundled catalog, computed locally — **not** a NOAA feed
  - NOAA/NWS publish no meteor shower data of any kind: the NWS alert taxonomy covers terrestrial
    hazards, and the Space Weather Prediction Center covers geomagnetic activity, not meteors
  - Shower parameters come from the IMO Meteor Shower Calendar and the IAU Meteor Data Center
    working list, stored by **solar longitude** rather than by date
  - Peak times, radiant altitudes, moon phase and astronomical darkness are all computed on your
    machine using standard positional astronomy — no API call, no API key, no extra dependency,
    and it works with no internet connection at all
- **Hurricane Data**: National Hurricane Center (NHC) and National Weather Service (NWS)
- **NWS Active Alerts**: National Weather Service weather.gov API
  - Location-specific severe weather warnings and watches
  - Flood, winter storm, and environmental alerts
  - Real-time alert monitoring with automatic filtering
- **Rip Current/Surf Data**: Location-specific NWS Surf Zone Forecasts (SRF products)
- **Weather Observations**: National Weather Service observation stations (weather.gov API)
  - Real-time temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, and sky conditions
  - Automatic unit conversions to US customary units

## Update Frequency
Most sensors update every 10 minutes to provide current conditions while respecting API rate limits.

Meteor shower entities update every 30 minutes. They fetch nothing, so there is no rate limit to
respect — but the best-of-night result is stable for hours, so a slower cadence keeps the recorder
database smaller for no loss of accuracy.

**Note:** Legacy YAML configurations without lat/lon will continue to work but will use the fallback office-to-station mapping for weather data. Config Flow setups require the new fields.
