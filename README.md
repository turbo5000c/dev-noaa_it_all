This Home Assistant integration provides comprehensive NOAA data through sensors and images, with the latest addition of location-specific rip current and surf zone forecasts.

## Installation & Configuration

### HACS Installation (Recommended)

#### Option 1: HACS Default Store (after acceptance)
1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click **Integrations**
3. Search for "NOAA Integration"
4. Click **Download**
5. Restart Home Assistant

#### Option 2: HACS Custom Repository
1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click the three-dot menu (⋮) → **Custom repositories**
3. Add `https://github.com/dawg-io/noaa_it_all` with category **Integration**
4. Click **Download** on the NOAA Integration card
5. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation
1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dawg-io/noaa_it_all/releases)
2. Copy the `custom_components/noaa_it_all` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

### Configuration

#### Config Flow (Recommended - New!)
For location-specific rip current, surf zone, and weather data:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Add Integration**
2. Search for "NOAA Integration"
3. Select your **NWS Forecast Office** from the dropdown (e.g., SGX for San Diego, LOX for Los Angeles)
4. **Enter your Latitude and Longitude** (required) - Weather observations will be fetched from the nearest station to this location
5. Complete the setup

**Important:** Starting with version 1.0.20, latitude and longitude are required fields for proper weather entity setup. Weather data is now fetched from the nearest observation station to your specified coordinates using the weather.gov API, rather than defaulting to the Home Assistant location or using a predefined office-to-station mapping.

#### Legacy YAML Configuration
For basic sensors without location-specific data:
```yaml
noaa_it_all:
```

## Device Grouping and Organization

The NOAA Integration organizes entities into logical device groups for better organization in Home Assistant. All entities are automatically grouped under one of the following devices:

### Device Groups Overview

#### 🌌 NOAA Space
Global space weather monitoring - aurora visibility, geomagnetic storms, and solar radiation alerts
- **Device ID**: `noaa_space`
- **Location**: Independent (global data)
- **Update Frequency**: 5 minutes

#### 🌤️ NOAA Weather
Global hurricane tracking, forecasts, and general weather observations
- **Device ID**: `noaa_weather`
- **Location**: Independent for hurricanes, location-specific for weather observations
- **Update Frequency**: 5 minutes

#### 🌊 NOAA Surf
Location-specific surf conditions, rip currents, and water temperature
- **Device ID**: `noaa_surf`
- **Location**: Specific to configured NWS office
- **Update Frequency**: 5 minutes

#### 📍 NOAA Weather [OFFICE]
Location-specific severe weather alerts and warnings (e.g., "NOAA Weather SGX" for San Diego)
- **Device ID**: `noaa_weather_{office_code}`
- **Location**: Specific to configured NWS office and coordinates
- **Update Frequency**: 5 minutes

> **Tip**: In Home Assistant's device view (Settings → Devices & Services), click on any NOAA device to see all related entities grouped together. This makes it easy to create dashboard cards and automations for specific categories of data.

## NWS Forecast Offices

The integration supports all NWS offices that issue Surf Zone Forecasts (SRF):

**East Coast**: Norfolk (AKQ), Boston (BOX), Wilmington NC (ILM), Charleston (CHS), Jacksonville (JAX), Miami (MFL), Tampa (TBW), etc.

**West Coast**: San Diego (SGX), Los Angeles (LOX), San Francisco (MTR), Portland OR (PQR), Eureka (EKA)

**Gulf Coast**: Mobile (MOB), Corpus Christi (CRP), Brownsville (BRO), Tallahassee (TAE)

**Great Lakes**: Chicago (LOT), Cleveland (CLE), Detroit (DTX), Milwaukee (MKX), Duluth (DLH)

**Pacific**: Honolulu (HFO), Guam (GUM)

## Entity Naming Conventions

Understanding entity naming helps you quickly identify and use sensors in automations and dashboards.

### Naming Pattern
All NOAA Integration entities follow this pattern:
```
{entity_type}.noaa_{office_code}_{sensor_name}
```

**Examples:**
- `sensor.noaa_sgx_temperature` - Temperature sensor for San Diego (SGX office)
- `binary_sensor.noaa_sgx_unsafe_to_swim` - Rip current safety for San Diego
- `sensor.noaa_weather_kp_index` - Global K-index (no office code, space weather)
- `binary_sensor.noaa_sgx_severe_weather_alert` - Severe weather alert for San Diego

### Office Code Usage
- **Location-specific sensors**: Include the office code (e.g., `sgx`, `lox`, `box`)
- **Global sensors**: Omit office code or use `weather`/`space` identifier
- **Replace office code**: If you change NWS offices, entity names will include the new code

### Entity Types
- **sensor.**: Numeric or text state (temperature, humidity, alert count, etc.)
- **binary_sensor.**: On/Off or True/False state (unsafe conditions, active alerts)
- **image.**: Visual data (radar, satellite, forecast images)

### Best Practices

1. **Use Device Views**: Access entities by device (Settings → Devices & Services → NOAA Integration) for organized browsing
2. **Create Groups**: Use Home Assistant groups to combine related entities across device boundaries
3. **Label Your Location**: In automations, use friendly names in messages (e.g., "San Diego" instead of "SGX")
4. **Check Availability**: Sensors return `unknown` or `None` when data is unavailable - use conditions to verify state
5. **Binary Sensors for Triggers**: Use binary sensors (`on`/`off`) for automation triggers instead of checking sensor values
6. **Access Attributes**: Many sensors include detailed information in attributes (e.g., full alert text, forecast periods)

### Quick Reference: Common Entity Patterns

| Data Type | Entity Pattern | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Weather Observation | `sensor.noaa_{office}_{metric}` | `sensor.noaa_sgx_temperature` |
| Weather Alert Binary | `binary_sensor.noaa_{office}_{alert_type}_alert` | `binary_sensor.noaa_sgx_severe_weather_alert` |
| Surf Conditions | `sensor.noaa_{office}_{surf_metric}` | `sensor.noaa_sgx_rip_current_risk` |
| Space Weather | `sensor.noaa_{space/weather}_{metric}` | `sensor.noaa_space_kp_index` |
| Aurora Predictions | `sensor.noaa_{office}_aurora_{metric}` | `sensor.noaa_dlh_aurora_next_time` |

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Entities Not Appearing
- Ensure you completed Config Flow setup with valid latitude and longitude
- Verify your NWS office code is listed in the [supported offices](#nws-forecast-offices) table
- Restart Home Assistant after adding or reconfiguring the integration
- Check **Settings** → **System** → **Logs** for any error messages from `noaa_it_all`

### Data Not Updating
- Check sensor attributes for error messages
- Verify internet connectivity from your Home Assistant instance
- NOAA APIs occasionally experience temporary outages; sensors will recover automatically
- Confirm scan interval is running: entities should show a `last_changed` time within the last 10 minutes

### Incorrect or Missing Weather Data
- Weather observations are pulled from the nearest NWS station to your configured coordinates
- Confirm your latitude and longitude are accurate (you can reconfigure via **Settings** → **Integrations** → **NOAA Integration** → **Configure**)
- Some NWS offices may not have nearby observation stations; in that case observations will show `unknown`

### Binary Sensors Always Off
- Binary sensors require Config Flow setup with a valid office code and coordinates
- Legacy YAML configuration does not support location-specific binary sensors

### Integration Fails to Load
- Confirm Home Assistant version is **2024.9.1 or newer**
- Check that required Python packages (`requests`, `aiohttp`) are available (they are bundled with HACS installations)
- Review Home Assistant logs for specific import or configuration errors

### FAQ

**Q: Can I use this integration without configuring latitude/longitude?**
A: Yes. Adding `noaa_it_all:` to `configuration.yaml` provides global sensors (Kp Index, Geomagnetic Storm, Hurricane data) without location-specific features.

**Q: How do I find my NWS forecast office code?**
A: Visit [weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov/) and search for your location. The three-letter office code appears in the URL of your local forecast page (e.g., `forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=San+Diego&state=CA&site=SGX`).

**Q: Why don't I see aurora predictions?**
A: Aurora predictions are location-specific and require Config Flow setup. Also, aurora is only visible at high Kp levels for southern latitudes — check the Kp Index value and your office's magnetic latitude.

**Q: How often does data update?**
A: All sensors update every 5 minutes.

**Q: Are UV Index readings available?**
A: No. UV Index is not provided through NWS/NOAA APIs and cannot be included in this integration.

**Q: Where can I report bugs or request features?**
A: Please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/dawg-io/noaa_it_all/issues).

## Data Sources

- **Space Weather**: NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center
  - Aurora visibility forecasts and geomagnetic storm data
  - Solar radiation storm alerts and classification (S1-S5 scale)
  - Real-time space weather alert monitoring
- **Hurricane Data**: National Hurricane Center (NHC) and National Weather Service (NWS)
- **NWS Active Alerts**: National Weather Service weather.gov API
  - Location-specific severe weather warnings and watches
  - Flood, winter storm, and environmental alerts
  - Real-time alert monitoring with automatic filtering
- **Rip Current/Surf Data**: Location-specific NWS Surf Zone Forecasts (SRF products)
- **Weather Observations**: National Weather Service observation stations (weather.gov API)
  - Real-time temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, and sky conditions
  - Automatic unit conversions to US customary units

## Update Frequency
All sensors update every 5 minutes to provide current conditions while respecting API rate limits.

**Note:** Legacy YAML configurations without lat/lon will continue to work but will use the fallback office-to-station mapping for weather data. Config Flow setups require the new fields.
