"""DataUpdateCoordinators for NOAA Integration.

Each coordinator fetches data from one or more related NOAA/NWS API
endpoints and makes it available to all entities that share the same
data domain.  This eliminates redundant per-entity polling and
centralises caching, error handling and rate-limit control.

    Held by composition rather than inherited. The two coordinators that compute rather than
    fetch both need to hand a ``tzinfo`` to a pure model that pre-formats local time strings, and
    both need the same two precautions -- but the test-suite substitutes a ``MagicMock`` for
    ``DataUpdateCoordinator``, and mixing a plain class into that raises a metaclass conflict at
    import time. A collaborator sidesteps the question entirely.

    The zone is read from ``hass.config.time_zone`` rather than through
    ``homeassistant.util.dt`` so this module keeps working under those same mocks, which stub
    ``homeassistant`` but not ``homeassistant.util``.

    The result is cached against the name it came from, because building a ``ZoneInfo`` reads the
    tz database from disk the first time a given key is used -- which without the cache happens
    on the event loop on every single refresh -- and because an unresolvable name would otherwise
    log the same warning every refresh, forever.

    Like ``MeteorShowerCoordinator`` this performs **no network I/O**: lunar eclipses are derived

    ``eclipse_catalog.py``. NASA publishes eclipse predictions as documents rather than as a feed,
    and there is nothing to observe in real time anyway -- the geometry was settled centuries ago.

    Unlike every other coordinator here, this one **changes its own update interval**. The others
    watch conditions that drift over hours; this one watches an event whose interesting part can
    last two minutes. Polling hourly is right when the next eclipse is three years away and
    hopeless when first contact is in ten. So the interval is re-derived on every refresh from
    how close the next eclipse is, which is the only way for a "go outside now" flag to be any
    use -- Home Assistant re-reads entity state when a coordinator publishes, so an entity that
    consulted the clock itself would simply never change.

    A full refresh measures 75-100 ms depending on the observer -- solving local circumstances
    for up to two dozen catalogued eclipses, most of which turn out to miss. That is an order of
    magnitude more than the meteor forecast next door, whose docstring gives "well under 10 ms"
    as its reason for running inline, so this one takes the other branch of the same rule and
    hands the work to an executor. It matters most in exactly the situation the tightened
    interval creates: a minute-by-minute poll while an eclipse is under way.
