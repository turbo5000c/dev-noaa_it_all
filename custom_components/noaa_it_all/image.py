the image is fetched from NOAA on a background timer and the last frame that

back that cached copy, so a transient upstream failure -- a DNS timeout, an
unreachable network, a 503 from NOAA -- leaves the previous picture on the

    The only image entity here whose URL is not fixed. NASA publishes one plot per eclipse, so
    which one to show depends on what the eclipse coordinator says is coming, and
    ``NoaaImageEntity`` supports exactly that through ``_base_url()``.

    Three things make this entity quieter than the others, all of them because it points at a
    per-eclipse URL rather than a live product:

    * **Not every eclipse has a map.** NASA plots the path only for *central* eclipses -- a
      purely partial one has no path to draw -- and its index stops in 2050. The catalog stores
      ``map_url`` as ``None`` for those, and this entity simply does not fetch.
    * **Nor does a lunar eclipse**, whose figures NASA publishes as PDFs. ``NoaaImageEntity``
      rejects anything that is not an image, so only solar eclipses are considered.
    * **Nor one that is years away.** A non-transient failure such as a 404 warns every refresh
      by design, which is right for a live NOAA product and wrong for a static page that might
      be years from being interesting. Advertising it only within ``ECLIPSE_MAP_DAYS`` bounds
      how long a moved URL could complain for.

    Fetching is skipped rather than failed when there is nothing to show, so the card keeps the
    last map it had instead of blanking.
