"""NOAA image entities.

Every entity here follows the same shape, provided by :class:`NoaaImageEntity`:
the image is fetched from NOAA on a background timer and the last frame that
came back successfully is kept in memory.  ``async_image()`` only ever hands
back that cached copy, so a transient upstream failure -- a DNS timeout, an
unreachable network, a 503 from NOAA -- leaves the previous picture on the
dashboard instead of blanking the tile.
