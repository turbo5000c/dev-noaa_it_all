"""Accumulate NEXRAD frames locally and assemble them into a long radar loop.

NOAA publishes a ready-made animation at ``{SITE}_loop.gif``, but it is fixed
at ten frames covering roughly fifty minutes, and the server keeps only those
ten frames.  A longer loop therefore cannot be downloaded; it has to be built
from frames collected over time.  This module owns that: a small on-disk ring
of single-scan GIFs per radar site, a sampler that picks evenly spaced frames
out of it, and a Pillow encoder that stitches them into one animation.

Nothing here imports Home Assistant.  ``hass`` is passed in solely to borrow
its executor, which keeps the file and image work off the event loop -- and
keeps this module testable against a real directory and a real Pillow without
any of the module mocking the entity tests need.
